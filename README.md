## Notes
I've noted that the way I've written this repo isnt very "react-like" or conventional. In that I haven't properly shoved everything into a component and then slapped a ui library on top. Now the current pure css with plain html element design is perfectly fine for this site. But do note for real situations you may want to consider looking into more "react-like" practices, esp when considering larger projects.
